The **`key` prop in React** is a **special and unique identifier** assigned to elements in a list to help React efficiently
manage and update those elements during re-renders.

### Why is the `key` prop important?

- **Identifies elements uniquely among siblings:** React uses keys to distinguish which items have changed, been added, or
  removed in a list. This helps React avoid re-rendering the entire list unnecessarily.
- **Optimizes rendering and reconciliation:** When the list changes, React compares the previous and next virtual DOM trees
  using keys to update only the affected elements, improving performance.
- **Maintains component state:** Keys help React preserve the state of components in a list when items reorder or update,
  preventing unexpected UI bugs.

### How to use the `key` prop:

- Assign a **unique value** (often an ID) to the `key` prop on each element inside a list.
- Keys must be **unique only among siblings**, not globally unique.
- Avoid using array indices as keys if the list can reorder or change, as this can cause rendering issues.

### Example:

```jsx
const items = [
  { id: 1, name: 'apple' },
  { id: 2, name: 'banana' },
  { id: 3, name: 'orange' }
];

function FruitList() {
  return (

      {items.map(item => (
        {item.name}
      ))}

  );
}
```

### Additional notes:

- The `key` prop is **not passed as a prop** to the component; it is used internally by React.
- Without keys or with improper keys, React may re-render more components than necessary or cause UI bugs during list
  updates.
- Keys help React's **diffing algorithm** (reconciliation) efficiently update the DOM.

**In summary:**  
The `key` prop is a unique identifier that React requires when rendering lists to **efficiently track and update elements**,
maintain component state, and optimize rendering performance[1][2][3][4][5].
