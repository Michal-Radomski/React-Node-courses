**Passing types to props in React** means defining the expected data structure and types of the props your component should
receive when using TypeScript. This allows you to catch errors at compile time and have better editor support such as
auto-completion and type checking.

### Why type props?

Without typing, props can be of any type which risks runtime errors. Typing props ensures:

- Components receive the expected prop types
- Errors are caught early by TypeScript
- Better self-documenting code and developer experience

### How to type props in React + TypeScript?

The common approach is to define a **type** or **interface** describing the shape of props your component expects, then
declare your functional component using that type.

### Example using `interface` and `React.FC`:

```tsx
import React from 'react';

interface MyComponentProps {
  title: string;
  count: number;
  disabled?: boolean; // optional prop
}

const MyComponent: React.FC = ({ title, count, disabled }) => {
  return (

      {title}
      Count: {count}
      {disabled && Disabled}

  );
};
```

- `MyComponentProps` describes the props: `title` is a required string, `count` a required number, and `disabled` an optional
  boolean.
- `MyComponent` takes those props and uses destructuring.
- Using `React.FC` ensures the component has the correct type for props and supports children implicitly.

### Alternative inline typing without `React.FC`:

```tsx
type MyProps = {
  name: string;
  isActive?: boolean;
};

function Greeting({ name, isActive }: MyProps) {
  return Hello {name}, you are {isActive ? 'active' : 'inactive'};
}
```

This style is also common and preferred by some because it doesn't add some implicit behaviors of `React.FC`.

### Supported prop types can include:

- Primitive types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`)
- Arrays (e.g. `string[]`)
- Literals/unions (e.g. `'high' | 'normal' | 'low'`)
- Objects and nested shapes
- Functions (`() => void`)
- React nodes (`React.ReactNode`) to type children or render functions
- CSS style objects (`React.CSSProperties`)

### Summary

**Passing a type to props means defining a TypeScript type or interface for the props your React component expects.** Then
use that type to declare your component's props for better static typing, error prevention, and developer tooling
support[1][2][4][5].

If you want, I can provide a more specific example based on your use case.
