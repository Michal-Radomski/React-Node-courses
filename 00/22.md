The key differences between **React.createRef** and **React.useRef** are related to their usage context, lifecycle, and
behavior during re-renders:

| Aspect                         | React.createRef                                                                          | React.useRef                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Usage Context**              | Used primarily in _class components_.                                                    | Used exclusively in _functional components_ (React hooks).                                                            |
| **Ref Object Creation**        | Creates a _new ref object on every render_.                                              | Returns the _same ref object on every render_, persisting across renders.                                             |
| **Initial Value**              | Does _not accept_ an initial value; `current` is initially `null`.                       | Accepts an _initial value_ as an argument; `current` is initialized to that value or `undefined` if none provided.    |
| **Persistence Across Renders** | Does _not_ persist the ref value between renders because it creates a new ref each time. | _Persists_ the ref value between renders, making it suitable for storing mutable values that do not cause re-renders. |
| **Typical Use Case**           | Legacy or class-based components where refs are assigned to instance properties.         | Functional components where hooks are used and stable refs are needed across renders.                                 |

### Explanation

- **React.createRef** is generally used in class components. Each time the component renders, `createRef()` creates a new ref
  object, so the previous ref is lost. This means it is not suitable for storing values that need to persist across renders
  in functional components[1][2][3][5][7].

- **React.useRef** is a hook designed for functional components. It returns the _same_ ref object on every render, so any
  value stored in `ref.current` persists across renders without causing re-renders. It can also take an initial value, which
  `createRef` cannot[1][2][3][5][7].

- Because `useRef` maintains the same object, it is ideal for keeping mutable values around, such as DOM references or any
  other value that should survive re-renders but not trigger them.

- `createRef` is considered somewhat legacy in modern React development, especially with the rise of hooks and functional
  components. It is mainly used when maintaining or working with class components[1][2][7].

### Summary

- Use **`React.useRef`** in functional components to create refs that persist across renders.
- Use **`React.createRef`** in class components, where a new ref is created typically once in the constructor and assigned to
  an instance property.

This distinction ensures refs behave correctly in different component paradigms within React.
