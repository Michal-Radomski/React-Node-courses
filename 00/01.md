The method `fs.createReadStream(filename)` in Node.js creates a readable stream for reading data from the specified file.
Instead of loading the entire file into memory, it reads the file incrementally in chunks, emitting "data" events as each
chunk becomes available. This makes it efficient and suitable for handling large files or streaming data progressively.

Key points about `fs.createReadStream(filename)`:

- It returns a **Readable Stream** object that emits events such as:
  - `"data"`: emitted when a chunk of data is available.
  - `"end"`: emitted when the entire file has been read.
  - `"error"`: emitted if an error occurs during reading.
  - `"open"` and `"close"`: emitted when the file is opened or closed.
- The stream starts in a paused state and begins flowing data only when a `"data"` event listener is attached or when
  `.read()` is called.
- It reads data asynchronously and efficiently, avoiding loading the whole file into memory at once.
- You can specify options such as encoding, file descriptor, start and end byte positions, and buffer size (`highWaterMark`).
- It is ideal for processing large files or for scenarios where you want to process or pipe data as it is read.

Example usage:

```js
const fs = require("fs");
const readStream = fs.createReadStream("file.txt");

readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
  console.log(`Received chunk: ${chunk}`);
});

readStream.on("end", () => {
  console.log("File reading complete.");
});

readStream.on("error", (err) => {
  console.error(`Error reading file: ${err}`);
});
```

This method provides flexibility, better performance for I/O-bound operations, and memory efficiency compared to reading the
entire file at once with methods like `fs.readFile`[1][2][3][5][8].
