A **polymorphic component pattern** in React is a design where a single component can render **different underlying HTML
elements or custom components** based on a prop (usually called `as`). This enables you to reuse the same component logic,
styles, and behaviors but output different DOM elements or components as needed â€” for example, a button that can also render
as a link.

### Why is it useful?

- Avoids creating many similar components for variations of the same UI element.
- Provides flexibility and better API ergonomics.
- Allows the consumer to choose the most semantically correct or appropriate element.
- Helps in building reusable design systems or component libraries.

### How it works

- You pass an `as` prop to the component specifying which HTML tag or custom component to render.
- The component uses this prop to dynamically render the element instead of a fixed one.
- Proper TypeScript typing can ensure the props passed are appropriate for the chosen element.

### Basic Example in React + TypeScript

```tsx
import React, { ElementType, ComponentPropsWithoutRef } from 'react';

interface PolymorphicProps {
  as?: T;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

// This type combines the polymorphic props with the props of the "as" element
type Props = PolymorphicProps & Omit, keyof PolymorphicProps>;

function PolymorphicComponent({
  as,
  children,
  ...restProps
}: Props) {
  const Component = as || 'button';
  return {children};
}

// Usage examples:

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* Render as a button */}
       alert('Clicked!')}>
        Button Element


      {/* Render as an anchor */}

        Anchor Element


      {/* Render as a div */}

        Div Element


  );
}
```

### Summary

| Concept                   | Description                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Polymorphic Component** | A React component that renders different underlying elements based on an `as` prop. |
| **`as` prop**             | Prop specifying the HTML tag or React component to render dynamically.              |
| **Benefits**              | Flexibility, reusability, semantic correctness, avoid duplication.                  |
| **TypeScript**            | Using generic parameter `` enables type-safe props for the rendered element.        |

This pattern is widely used by popular libraries like **Material-UI (MUI)** (e.g., their `Typography` component), **Chakra
UI**, and many design systems to achieve flexible and reusable components[1][2][3][4][6][7].
