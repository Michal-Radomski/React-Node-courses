The React hook **useTransition** (introduced in React 18) is used to mark certain state updates as _non-urgent_ or
_transitions_, allowing React to prioritize more important updates (like user input) and keep the UI responsive during
potentially slow or heavy rendering tasks.

### How useTransition works:

- It returns a tuple: `[isPending, startTransition]`.
  - `isPending` is a boolean indicating if the transition update is still in progress.
  - `startTransition` is a function that you wrap around non-urgent state updates.
- When you wrap a state update inside `startTransition`, React treats it as a low-priority update. This means React can
  interrupt or delay this update to prioritize urgent updates, avoiding UI blocking or jank.

### Why useTransition is useful:

- Improves user experience by keeping interactions smooth even when rendering expensive changes.
- Prevents UI freezing during large or complex updates (e.g., filtering large lists, fetching data).
- Provides a built-in way to show loading indicators (`isPending`) while the transition is ongoing.

### Example usage:

```jsx
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
const [filteredUsers, setFilteredUsers] = useState([]);

const handleChange = (e) => {
  setSearchTerm(e.target.value); // urgent update

  startTransition(() => {
    // non-urgent update, can be deferred
    setFilteredUsers(users.filter(user => user.name.includes(e.target.value)));
  });
};

return (
  <>

    {isPending ? Loading... : }

);
```

### Summary:

- **useTransition** lets you mark updates as _transitions_ that React can delay or interrupt to keep the app responsive.
- It is ideal for expensive or slow updates that don't need to happen immediately.
- It provides a way to track pending state and show feedback to users during these transitions.

This hook is a key tool in React's Concurrent Mode for building smooth, performant user interfaces[1][2][4][5][6].
