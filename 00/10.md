`fs.promises` is a part of the Node.js `fs` (file system) module that provides promise-based asynchronous file system
methods. Unlike the traditional callback-based `fs` API, the methods in `fs.promises` return promises, which makes it easier
to use with modern JavaScript features like `async/await` for cleaner, more readable code.

### Key points about `fs.promises`:

- It offers asynchronous file operations that return promises instead of using callbacks.
- You can perform common file tasks such as reading, writing, appending, and deleting files with promise-based methods like
  `readFile()`, `writeFile()`, `appendFile()`, and `unlink()`.
- Using `fs.promises` helps avoid "callback hell" by enabling straightforward error handling with `try/catch` and sequential
  asynchronous code with `await`.
- It is imported differently from the callback-based `fs` API:

```js
const fs = require("fs").promises;
// or using ES modules
import * as fs from "node:fs/promises";
```

### Example usage:

```js
const fs = require("fs").promises;

async function readExample() {
  try {
    const data = await fs.readFile("example.txt", "utf8");
    console.log("File content:", data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error reading file:", error);
  }
}

readExample();
```

This approach contrasts with the traditional callback style and provides a more modern, promise-based interface to interact
with the file system[1][2][4][5].
