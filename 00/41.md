**Type helpers in TypeScript** are special types that accept other types as arguments and return new types, similar to how
functions work but at the type level instead of runtime values. They are used to facilitate common type transformations and
improve type composition and reuse in your code[1].

For example, the built-in type helper **`Record`** takes two type parameters: a key type and a value type, and produces an
object type with those keys and values:

```ts
type MyObj = Record;
const obj: MyObj = { foo: "bar" };
// obj.foo is a string, obj keys are strings
```

Here, `Record` means an object type with string keys and string values[1].

Type helpers can be generic type aliases that transform or compose types. Examples of common utility type helpers shipped
with TypeScript include `Partial` (to make all properties optional), `Required` (to make all properties required), `Omit` (to
exclude certain keys), and `Awaited` (to unwrap Promise types)[2][6].

These helpers enable more expressive and concise type definitions in TypeScript by leveraging generic type parameters, mapped
types, and conditional types.

In summary:

- **Type helpers operate like functions but on types, not values.**
- They accept type parameters to produce new tailored types.
- Examples: `Record`, `Partial`, `Required`, `Omit`, `Awaited`.
- Enable code reuse, improved type safety, and expressiveness.

This concept is distinct from helper classes or utility functions in JavaScript/TypeScript code, which provide reusable
runtime functionality. Type helpers are purely at the compile-time type system level[1][2].

If you want, I can provide more examples of specific type helpers or how to create your own.

A simple example of a **custom type helper** in TypeScript is one that makes a type nullable by including `null` and
`undefined`. Instead of repeatedly writing `T | null | undefined` in your code, you can define a reusable type helper like
this:

```ts
type Maybe = T | null | undefined;
```

You use it by passing in any type `T`, and the resulting type allows that type or `null` or `undefined`.

Example usage:

```ts
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  phoneNumber: Maybe; // phoneNumber can be string, null, or undefined
}
```

This `Maybe` type helper improves code clarity and reduces repetition wherever nullable values are allowed in your app[1].

Another example based on a challenge to create a flexible reusable type helper is this one:

```ts
type CreateDataShape = {
  data: Data;
  error: Error;
};
```

Pass in types for your data and error, and you get back an object type with those typed properties, making it easy to define
consistent shapes[5].

Such custom type helpers leverage generic type parameters and are fundamental to writing expressive, reusable typings in
TypeScript[1][5]. If you want, I can help you build more complex custom type helpers tailored to specific needs.
