The key difference between an **action** and an **action creator** in Redux is:

- An **action** is a plain JavaScript object that represents an event or intention to change the state. It must have a `type`
  property and can optionally include other data in a `payload`. For example:

```js
{ type: 'ADD_TODO', payload: { text: 'Learn Redux' } }
```

- An **action creator** is a function that _creates and returns_ an action object. It encapsulates the process of building
  the action, often taking parameters to customize the payload. For example:

```js
function addTodo(text) {
  return { type: "ADD_TODO", payload: { text } };
}
```

In practice, you call an action creator to get an action, then dispatch that action to the Redux store. Action creators help
keep your code organized, reusable, and maintainable by centralizing how actions are constructed, especially when the action
requires some logic or dynamic data (like generating unique IDs)[1][3][4][6][8].

To summarize:

| Aspect          | Action                             | Action Creator                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| What it is      | A plain object describing an event | A function that returns an action object        |
| Required fields | Must have a `type` property        | Returns an object with a `type` property        |
| Purpose         | Represents a change to state       | Creates and returns action objects for dispatch |
| Usage           | Dispatched to the Redux store      | Called to produce an action to dispatch         |

This distinction is fundamental in Redux because actions are the payloads sent to the store, while action creators are the
factory functions that produce these payloads[1][3][6][8].

To **dispatch an action** in Redux, you use the store's `dispatch` method and pass an action object to it. For example:

```js
store.dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" });
```

This sends the action to the Redux store, triggering the reducers to update the state accordingly[4].

When you have an **action creator** (a function that returns an action object), you first call the action creator to get the
action, then dispatch the result. For example:

```js
function increment() {
  return { type: "INCREMENT" };
}

store.dispatch(increment());
```

Here, `increment()` is the action creator, and its returned action is dispatched[1][4].

In React-Redux, you often use the `useDispatch` hook or `connect` with `mapDispatchToProps` to dispatch actions or action
creators inside components:

- Using `useDispatch` hook:

```js
import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";

const dispatch = useDispatch();
dispatch(increment()); // dispatching action created by action creator
```

- Using `mapDispatchToProps` with `bindActionCreators`:

```js
import { bindActionCreators } from "redux";
import * as actionCreators from "./actions";

function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
  return bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch);
}
```

This binds all action creators so you can call them directly in props, and they will dispatch automatically[2].

| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Action (object)**           | `store.dispatch({ type: 'ACTION_TYPE' })`                                                               |
| **Action creator (function)** | `store.dispatch(actionCreator(args))`                                                                   |
| **In React component**        | Use `dispatch(actionCreator())` or bind action creators with `mapDispatchToProps` or `useDispatch` hook |

Dispatching an action creator means calling the function to get the action object, then dispatching that object. You never
dispatch the action creator function itself directly[1][2][4].

```js
const getRoutes = () => async (dispatch, getState) => {
  try {
    const data = await axios.get("url");
    dispatch({ type: GET_ROUTES_DETAILS, payload: data });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("error");
  }
};

const Test = (): JSX.Element => {
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch();

  React.useEffect(() => {
    dispatch(getRoutes());
  }, [dispatch]);

  return Test;
};
```

### What is happening here?

1. **`getRoutes` is an action creator that returns a thunk function.**

- When you call `getRoutes()`, it returns an **async function** with signature `(dispatch, getState) => { ... }`.
- This returned function is called a **thunk** â€” a function that delays execution and can perform asynchronous side effects.
- The thunk receives `dispatch` and `getState` as arguments, so it can dispatch other actions or read the current state.

2. **Dispatching the thunk**

- When you do `dispatch(getRoutes())`, you are dispatching the thunk function.
- Redux Thunk middleware intercepts this function, calls it with `dispatch` and `getState`.
- Inside the thunk, you perform an async API call (`axios.get("url")`).
- When the data arrives, you dispatch a plain action `{ type: GET_ROUTES_DETAILS, payload: data }` to update the Redux store.

3. **In the React component**

- `useAppDispatch()` is a typed version of `useDispatch()` from React-Redux hooks.
- Inside `useEffect`, you dispatch the thunk action creator result (`getRoutes()`).
- This triggers the async flow when the component mounts.

### Difference between this snippet and a "regular" action creator function

| Aspect                        | Regular Action Creator                    | Thunk Action Creator (Your snippet)                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Returns                       | A plain action object `{ type, payload }` | A function `(dispatch, getState) => { ... }` (thunk)                                                          |
| Purpose                       | Describes _what_ happened                 | Defines _how_ and _when_ to dispatch actions (async logic)                                                    |
| Dispatch usage                | `dispatch(actionCreator(args))`           | `dispatch(thunkActionCreator(args))`                                                                          |
| Middleware required           | No middleware needed                      | Requires Redux Thunk middleware to handle functions                                                           |
| Can perform async operations? | No                                        | Yes, can perform async calls and dispatch multiple actions                                                    |
| Example                       | `() => ({ type: 'INCREMENT' })`           | `() => async (dispatch) => { const data = await fetch(); dispatch({ type: 'DATA_LOADED', payload: data }); }` |

### Summary

- Your `getRoutes` is **not** a plain action creator; it is a **thunk action creator**.
- Calling `getRoutes()` returns a thunk function that Redux Thunk middleware can execute.
- This allows you to handle async side effects (like API calls) inside Redux actions.
- Regular action creators return plain objects immediately; thunk action creators return functions that perform async logic
  and dispatch actions later.

If you want a simple analogy:

- **Regular action creator:** "Here is an action describing what happened."
- **Thunk action creator:** "Here is a function that will do some work (like fetching data), then dispatch actions when
  ready."

Let me know if you want me to explain how this integrates with Redux middleware or how to set up Redux Thunk!
