The React hook **useTransition()** is designed to improve UI responsiveness by marking certain state updates as _non-urgent_
or _low-priority_. This allows React to delay these updates and render more urgent UI changes immediately, preventing the
interface from blocking or lagging during expensive or large updates.

### Key purposes of useTransition():

- **Mark state updates as transitions:** You wrap non-urgent state updates inside the `startTransition()` function to
  indicate they can be deferred.
- **Track pending transitions:** The hook returns an `isPending` boolean that tells you if a transition is ongoing, useful
  for showing loading indicators.
- **Improve performance:** By deferring less critical updates, the UI remains responsive to user inputs, especially during
  heavy computations or large data filtering.

### How it works:

```js
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

function handleChange(event) {
  setSearchTerm(event.target.value); // urgent update

  startTransition(() => {
    setFilteredData(data.filter((item) => item.includes(event.target.value))); // non-urgent update wrapped in transition
  });
}
```

Here, filtering a large list is marked as a transition, so React can prioritize rendering the input update immediately and
defer the expensive filtering rendering, showing a loading state if needed.

### Benefits:

- Prevents UI blocking during expensive state updates.
- Prioritizes urgent updates like user input.
- Provides a built-in way to track and display loading states during transitions.

### Summary:

**useTransition()** is a React 18+ hook that lets you mark some state updates as transitions to keep the UI smooth and
responsive by deferring non-urgent updates and tracking their pending status[1][2][5][7].
