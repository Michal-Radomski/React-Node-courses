Besides `React.PropsWithChildren` and `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef`, TypeScript provides many other **utility types** that
help transform and manipulate types efficiently. These are widely used in React and general TypeScript codebases for safer
and more expressive typings. Key examples include:

| Utility Type    | Description                                                                 | Example Use Case                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Partial**     | Makes _all properties optional_ in a type                                   | Useful for update functions or optional props  |
| **Required**    | Makes _all properties required_, opposite of Partial                        | Enforce all props to be provided               |
| **Readonly**    | Makes all properties of a type _readonly_                                   | To prevent modification of objects             |
| **Pick**        | Creates a type by _picking a subset_ of properties from another type        | Selecting specific props for a component       |
| **Omit**        | Creates a type by _omitting certain keys_ from another type                 | Excluding props not needed in certain contexts |
| **Record**      | Constructs an object type with a given set of keys and a uniform value type | Mapping keys to consistent value types         |
| **Exclude**     | Removes from a union those types that are assignable to another union       | Filtering union types                          |
| **Extract**     | Extracts from a type all union members that are assignable to another union | Narrowing down union types                     |
| **NonNullable** | Removes `null` and `undefined` from a type                                  | Ensuring a type cannot be null/undefined       |
| **Parameters**  | Gets a tuple type of the parameters of a function                           | Inferring function argument types              |
| **ReturnType**  | Extracts the return type of a function                                      | Inferring function return types                |
| **Awaited**     | Recursively unwraps Promise types to get the resolved value                 | Handling async/await return types              |

#### Brief examples:

```ts
interface User { id: number; name: string; email?: string; }

// Partial: email becomes optional
type PartialUser = Partial;

// Required: makes email required
type FullUser = Required;

// Pick: only id and name
type UserPreview = Pick;

// Omit: all except email
type UserEmail = Omit;

// Record: map user IDs to usernames
type UserMap = Record;

// Exclude: remove string from union
type Numeric = Exclude;

// NonNullable: remove null/undefined
type StrictUser = NonNullable;

// Parameters: [id: number, name: string]
type FnParams = Parameters void>;

// ReturnType: string
type FnReturn = ReturnType string>;
```

These utilities empower you to construct flexible, composable prop and state types, reduce boilerplate, and avoid common type
errors. They're fundamental tools for sophisticated React + TypeScript development.
