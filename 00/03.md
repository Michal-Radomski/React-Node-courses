## What is setImmediate?

`setImmediate()` is a Node.js function that schedules a callback to be executed asynchronously on the next iteration of the
event loop, immediately after the current event loop phase completes. It allows you to run code asynchronously but as soon as
possible, without blocking the event loop[1][3][6].

### How it works in the event loop

- `process.nextTick()` callbacks run immediately after the current operation, before the event loop continues.
- `Promise.then()` callbacks run in the microtask queue after `process.nextTick`.
- `setImmediate()` callbacks run in the macrotask queue on the next iteration of the event loop.
- `setTimeout(fn, 0)` is similar to `setImmediate()`, but the exact order between them can vary depending on the
  environment[1].

### Use cases

- Deferring execution of a callback until after the current event is fully processed.
- Breaking up long-running CPU-bound tasks into smaller chunks to avoid blocking the event loop.
- Ensuring callbacks are always called asynchronously for consistent programming behavior[3].

## Example of setImmediate in TypeScript

```typescript
function example() {
  console.log("Start");

  setImmediate(() => {
    console.log("Executed in setImmediate callback");
  });

  console.log("End");
}

example();
```

### Expected output

```
Start
End
Executed in setImmediate callback
```

Explanation: The synchronous code runs first (`Start` and `End`), then the `setImmediate` callback runs on the next iteration
of the event loop[1][6].

This example demonstrates how `setImmediate()` defers the callback until after the current synchronous code finishes
executing.

This explanation and example are based on Node.js usage of `setImmediate()`, which is the primary environment where it is
supported and useful. Note that `setImmediate()` is not standard in browsers and is deprecated or non-standard there[2].
