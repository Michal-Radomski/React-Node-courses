Partial autocomplete in TypeScript refers to a situation where you want to get autocomplete (intellisense) support for an
object type that only has some of its properties specified, not all. This often comes up when you use the utility type
Partial<T>, which makes all the properties of type T optional, allowing objects with zero or more of the properties of T.
Context and Explanation:

    When you define a function returning a full type FooType, but only provide part of the properties, TypeScript shows errors because the full type requires all properties.

    Using Partial<FooType> as a return type allows you to return an object with only some properties, and you get autocomplete for those properties within the partial object. This supports writing factory functions returning partial objects that can later be combined into a full object.

    However, using just a union like "foo" | "bar" | string or Partial<T> can cause issues where TypeScript either loses autocomplete suggestions or doesnâ€™t narrow types correctly.

    A popular trick to get autocomplete suggestions on a type union but still allow arbitrary strings (which is related to partial autocomplete) is to intersect string with an empty object like (string & {}). For example:

ts type LooseString = "foo" | "bar" | (string & {});

This enables autocomplete for "foo" and "bar" but still accepts any string value without error, a workaround for the
"autocomplete quirk" in TypeScript

    .

Summary:

    Partial autocomplete in TS is mainly using Partial<T> to get autocomplete on some properties of a type.

    This allows writing functions returning partial objects while still enjoying Intellisense for available properties.

    For string literals with autocomplete but allowing arbitrary strings, a common pattern is to intersect string with {} to preserve suggestions without total restriction.

    This pattern is often used in React components and APIs where some prop values are suggested but others are allowed freely.

This approach balances autocomplete usability with flexibility in typed codebases .
