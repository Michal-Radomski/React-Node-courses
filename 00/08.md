In Node.js, `process.on("SIGINT")` and `process.on("SIGTERM")` are event listeners that catch specific signals sent to the
process, allowing you to handle them gracefully before the process exits.

### What are SIGINT and SIGTERM?

- **SIGINT (Signal Interrupt):**  
  This signal is sent to a process by the terminal when a user wants to interrupt it, typically by pressing **Ctrl+C**. It is
  intended to interrupt the current operation and return control to the user or shell. The process can catch this signal to
  perform cleanup tasks before exiting[1][2][3].

- **SIGTERM (Signal Terminate):**  
  This signal requests a process to terminate gracefully. It is the default signal sent by commands like `kill `. Unlike
  SIGKILL, SIGTERM can be caught and handled, allowing the process to close files, release resources, or save state before
  shutting down[1][2][4].

### How does `process.on("SIGINT")` and `process.on("SIGTERM")` work in Node.js?

- You can listen for these signals using:

  ```js
  process.on("SIGINT", () => {
    console.log("Received SIGINT");
    // cleanup code here
    process.exit(0);
  });

  process.on("SIGTERM", () => {
    console.log("Received SIGTERM");
    // cleanup code here
    process.exit(0);
  });
  ```

- This lets your Node.js application intercept these signals and perform actions like closing servers, cleaning up resources,
  or saving state before exiting[1][2][5].

### Key points

- Both signals can be caught and handled in Node.js; your process can delay or control shutdown by handling these
  signals[1][5][6].
- You **cannot** catch or handle `SIGKILL` (signal 9), which immediately terminates the process without cleanup[1][4][6].
- Handling these signals is useful for graceful shutdowns, especially in server applications where you want to close
  connections properly before exit[1][5].

### Summary

- `process.on("SIGINT")` listens for the interrupt signal (Ctrl+C).
- `process.on("SIGTERM")` listens for the termination request signal (e.g., from `kill` command).
- Both allow graceful shutdown handling in Node.js.
- `SIGKILL` cannot be caught or handled.

This mechanism helps maintain application stability and resource management during shutdown[1][2][4][5].
