The main differences between `spawn` and `exec` in Node.js's `child_process` module are related to how they handle output and
process execution:

| Aspect                    | `spawn`                                                                                                                 | `exec`                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Output handling**       | Returns a `ChildProcess` with `stdout` and `stderr` as streams. You can read data incrementally as it is produced.      | Buffers the entire output (stdout and stderr) and returns it all at once in a callback. The default buffer size is limited (200KB or 1MB depending on Node version). |
| **Use case**              | Best for long-running processes or those producing large amounts of output, such as streaming data or image processing. | Suitable for short-lived commands with small output, like running simple commands or getting status messages.                                                        |
| **Execution**             | Does not spawn a shell by default; runs the command directly.                                                           | Spawns a shell to execute the command, allowing shell features like pipes, redirects, and multiple commands.                                                         |
| **Memory usage**          | Efficient for large outputs because it streams data and does not buffer it all in memory.                               | Can cause crashes if output exceeds the buffer limit (`maxBuffer exceeded` error).                                                                                   |
| **Asynchronous behavior** | "Asynchronously asynchronous": streams data as soon as the child process produces it.                                   | "Synchronously asynchronous": waits for the child process to finish and buffers all output before returning it.                                                      |

### Summary:

- Use **`spawn`** when you need to handle large or continuous output streams or run long-lived processes. It gives you
  fine-grained control over the child processâ€™s input/output streams.
- Use **`exec`** when you want to run a command and get the complete output as a string once the process finishes, especially
  for simple commands or when you need shell features like piping or redirection.

### Example of `spawn`:

```js
const { spawn } = require("child_process");
const ls = spawn("ls", ["-lh", "/usr"]);
ls.stdout.on("data", (data) => {
  console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
});
ls.stderr.on("data", (data) => {
  console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
});
ls.on("close", (code) => {
  console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
});
```

### Example of `exec`:

```js
const { exec } = require("child_process");
exec("ls -lh /usr", (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(`error: ${error.message}`);
    return;
  }
  if (stderr) {
    console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
    return;
  }
  console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
});
```

These distinctions help decide which method to use depending on your application's needs[1][2][3].
