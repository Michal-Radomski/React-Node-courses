The **production build of a React app is smaller in size than the development bundle** because it is optimized specifically
for performance and size reduction by removing development-only features and applying various optimizations during bundling.

Key reasons why production builds are smaller include:

- **Minification and Compression:** Production builds minify JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, removing whitespace, shortening
  variable names, and compressing the code to reduce file size significantly[3][6][5].

- **Removal of Development-Only Code:** Development builds include extra code for features like error warnings, verbose
  logging, debugging helpers, hot reloading, and React Developer Tools support, which are stripped out during production
  builds[3][5][6].

- **Elimination of Runtime Warnings and Checks:** Prop-types warnings, development hints, and other runtime checks present in
  development are omitted in production, shrinking the bundle size and improving runtime speed[2][5].

- **Code Splitting and Optimizations:** Production builds split code into smaller chunks and optimize imports to reduce
  overall payload size and speed up loading times[3][6].

- **Precompiled React Builds:** React packages provide separate development and production builds that are precompiled. The
  production bundle excludes code meant only for development (e.g., extra debugging utilities), further shrinking size[8].

- **Source Maps and Debugging Tools:** Development builds often contain inline source maps and tooling support embedded for
  easier debugging, which increase size and are disabled or externalized in production[3][6].

Thus, running `npm run build` or a production Webpack build triggers these optimizations, producing smaller, faster bundles
ideal for deployment. Development builds prioritize better developer experience but are larger and slower, hence not
recommended for production use[2][3][5].

**Summary Table:**

| Build Type        | Features                                               | Bundle Size Impact        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Development Build | Includes debug info, warnings, hot reload, source maps | Larger size, slower build |
| Production Build  | Minified, no debug code, no warnings, code splitting   | Smaller size, faster load |
