The React hook **useDeferredValue** is designed to improve UI responsiveness by deferring the update of a value to a
lower-priority render. It allows React to postpone rendering parts of the UI that depend on a non-urgent value, so that more
critical updates (like user input) can happen immediately without lag[1][2][3][4].

### Key points about useDeferredValue:

- It **does not make rendering faster** but makes the app _feel_ faster by keeping interactions smooth and deferring
  expensive or non-critical UI updates until the browser has spare time[3].
- The hook returns a **deferred version of the input value** that lags behind the original value and updates asynchronously,
  allowing React to interrupt and prioritize more urgent updates[4][7].
- Use cases include scenarios where rendering depends on large datasets, expensive computations, or frequently updated values
  that are not critical to update instantly (e.g., filtering a large list while typing)[3][7].
- It helps maintain a **snappy UI**, especially in high-interaction components like search inputs with heavy result lists,
  dashboards, or live previews[2][3][7].
- Syntax example:

```jsx
const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value);
```

Here, `deferredValue` updates less urgently than `value`, allowing React to prioritize other UI updates first[4][7].

### Summary

**useDeferredValue** is a React 18 hook that defers rendering updates for non-critical values, improving perceived
performance and user experience by keeping the UI responsive during heavy or frequent updates[1][3][7].
