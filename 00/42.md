**Constraints in TypeScript** are rules that restrict generic type parameters to types that fulfill certain criteria,
ensuring type safety and predictability. Constraints are specified using the `extends` keyword in a generic declaration,
which means the generic type must be assignable to (or comply with) the given constraint type, such as an interface, class,
or another type structure [1][5].

This allows you to access specific properties or methods on the generic type inside the function or class, knowing the type
meets the constraint. If a type argument does not satisfy the constraint, TypeScript will give a compile-time error.

### Example of constraints in TypeScript:

```ts
interface Lengthwise {
  length: number;
}

// Here T is constrained to types that have a 'length' property
function whatIsLength(x: T): string {
  return x.length >= 10 ? "Long enough" : "Too short";
}

console.log(whatIsLength("Hello, world!")); // Works: string has length
console.log(whatIsLength([1, 2, 3])); // Works: array has length
// console.log(whatIsLength(123));            // Error: number has no 'length' property
```

In this example:

- The generic type parameter `T` must have a `length` property because it extends the `Lengthwise` interface.
- You can safely access `x.length` inside the function without type errors.
- Calling `whatIsLength` with a number causes a compile-time error because `number` doesn't satisfy the constraint [1][5].

This enables you to write flexible yet type-safe generic code by narrowing down generic types to those that match specific
shapes or behaviors.

Another practical use is constraining generic types to objects, keys of objects, or classes to ensure valid property access
or object construction, for example:

```ts
function getProperty(obj: Type, key: Key) {
  return obj[key];
}
```

Here `Key` is constrained to be one of the keys of `Type`, preventing access to invalid keys at compile time [3].

**Summary:**

- **Constraints use `extends` to restrict generic types.**
- They ensure generic type parameters uphold certain structure or interface.
- Enable safe property/method access inside generics.
- Help catch type errors early during development.

This makes constraints a powerful mechanism for building reusable and robust generic components in TypeScript.
