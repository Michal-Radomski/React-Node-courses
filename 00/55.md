A **React Pure Component** is a class component that extends `React.PureComponent`. Unlike a regular component, it
automatically implements the lifecycle method `shouldComponentUpdate()` by performing a **shallow comparison** of the current
and next props and state. If neither props nor state have changed (based on this shallow comparison), the Pure Component
**skips re-rendering**, thus improving performance by avoiding unnecessary updates[1][2][4].

Key points about React Pure Components:

- They behave like regular class components but with an automatic optimization to prevent re-renders when inputs (props and
  state) remain unchanged.
- Their `shouldComponentUpdate` compares only at a shallow level (does not deeply check nested objects).
- Useful when you want to optimize performance, especially in large apps or with components rendering large lists or
  tables[1][5].
- When props or state are the same, a Pure Componentâ€™s render is skipped.
- Functional components can achieve similar behavior using `React.memo`, which memoizes the component rendering based on
  props equality[2][3][6].

In practical terms, extending `React.PureComponent` looks like this:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class MyPureComponent extends React.PureComponent {
  render() {
    return {this.props.name};
  }
}
```

Here, if the `name` prop does not change, `MyPureComponent` will not re-render even if its parent renders again[1][3][4].

This contrasts with normal components, which re-render whenever their parent re-renders, regardless of prop changes.

In summary, **React Pure Components improve application performance by preventing unnecessary renders through shallow prop
and state comparison automatically implemented in `PureComponent`**[1][2][4]. For functional components, the recommended
modern approach is using `React.memo` to achieve similar pure behavior[6].
