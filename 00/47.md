**React.PropsWithChildren** and **React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef** are TypeScript utility types in React used to assist with
typing component props, especially when dealing with children or DOM attributes.

### 1. React.PropsWithChildren

- **Purpose:**  
  It is a generic type that takes your component’s props type and _adds the `children` prop_ to it, appropriately typed as
  `ReactNode`. This helps when you want to specify that your component accepts children without manually adding a `children`
  prop in your prop definitions.

- **Usage & Benefits:**  
  Instead of manually typing children as `children?: React.ReactNode`, `PropsWithChildren` automatically merges your props
  `P` with the children prop, reducing boilerplate and improving type safety. It's commonly used in function components to
  clearly indicate they accept children, either mandatory or optional.

- **Example:**

  ```tsx
  import { PropsWithChildren } from 'react';

  type MyProps = { title: string };

  const MyComponent: React.FC> = ({ title, children }) => (

      {title}
      {children}

  );
  ```

  Here, `children` is correctly typed without explicitly declaring it in `MyProps`[1][2][3][6][8].

- **Additional Notes:**
  - You can also use `PropsWithChildren` without any other props (`PropsWithChildren` or simply `PropsWithChildren`) when
    your component only accepts children[4].
  - It is preferred over manually declaring `children` in your props for cleaner, safer code[1][2][6].

### 2. React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef

- **Purpose:**  
  This is a utility type that extracts the prop types of a React component or intrinsic HTML element _excluding_ the `ref`
  prop. It is useful when you want to reuse the prop types of built-in or custom components but do not want to deal
  explicitly with the `ref` forwarding.

- **Typical Use Case:**  
  For example, to get the props of a `button` element without the `ref`, you write:

  ```ts
  type ButtonProps = React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef;
  ```

  This allows your custom components or wrappers to accept all the standard props of a native element or another component
  without the complexities of `ref`.

- **Why exclude `ref`?**  
  Because managing `ref` types can be complicated and might not be necessary for your use case, so this type makes it easier
  to type props cleanly.

- **Example:**  
  Suppose you are building a custom button component and want to inherit all native button props except `ref`:

  ```tsx
  type MyButtonProps = React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef & { customProp: string };

  const MyButton = ({ customProp, ...rest }: MyButtonProps) => ({ customProp });
  ```

### Summary table:

| Type                               | Purpose                                                         | Typical Usage                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **React.PropsWithChildren**        | Add `children` prop to existing props type                      | Typing components that accept children, e.g. `PropsWithChildren`         |
| **React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef** | Extract props of component or HTML element _without_ `ref` prop | Extending native element props without handling `ref`, e.g. for wrappers |

In essence:

- Use **`PropsWithChildren`** when you want to **add children** typing automatically to your component props.
- Use **`ComponentPropsWithoutRef`** when you want to **reuse prop types from another component or native element** but want
  to omit the `ref` from those props for simpler typing.

These utilities simplify and enforce safer typings in React + TypeScript apps[1][2][4][6].

In addition to `React.PropsWithChildren` and `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef`, React’s TypeScript typings provide several
similar **utility types** to help with component props and element attributes:

### Common React Utility Types

| Utility Type                       | Description                                                                                         | Typical Use Case                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **React.PropsWithChildren**        | Adds an optional `children` prop of type `ReactNode` to your props `P`.                             | Typing components that accept children without manually typing `children` |
| **React.ComponentProps**           | Gets the prop types of a React component or intrinsic element `T`, **including** a forwarded `ref`. | Useful to reuse props of a component or element, including ref            |
| **React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef** | Gets the prop types of a React component or intrinsic element `T`, but **excludes** the `ref` prop. | Use when you want to reuse props without ref considerations               |
| **React.HTMLAttributes**           | Type for all standard HTML attributes, suitable as props for elements like `, `.                    | Defining props for components wrapping native DOM elements                |
| **React.SVGAttributes**            | Type for SVG element attributes, useful for components rendering SVG elements.                      | Typing SVG element props                                                  |
| **React.FC** (Function Component)  | Includes `children` automatically; defines standard component with typed props and children.        | To type React function components conveniently                            |

### Example usage within React:

```tsx
import React from 'react';

// PropsWithChildren adds `children` prop automatically
type MyProps = { title: string };
const MyComponent: React.FC> = ({ title, children }) => (

    {title}
    {children}

);

// Reuse HTML button attributes without ref
type ButtonProps = React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef & { customProp?: boolean };

const MyButton: React.FC = ({ customProp, ...rest }) => (
  {customProp ? "Clicked" : "Click me"}
);
```

### Summary:

- **`PropsWithChildren`** is for _adding children_ to your props.
- **`ComponentPropsWithoutRef`** helps you _extract props_ of HTML elements or components but _exclude refs_.
- **`ComponentProps`** also extracts props but _includes refs_.
- **`HTMLAttributes`** and **`SVGAttributes`** give you the standard DOM/SVG props for native elements.

These React-specific utility types complement the core TypeScript utility types (`Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`, etc.) to make
typing React components safer, more expressive, and more maintainable. They help bridge React's component and element
patterns with TypeScript’s powerful type system.
