**React.PropsWithChildren** and **React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef** are TypeScript utility types in React used to assist with
typing component props, especially when dealing with children or DOM attributes.

### 1. React.PropsWithChildren

- **Purpose:**  
  It is a generic type that takes your componentâ€™s props type and _adds the `children` prop_ to it, appropriately typed as
  `ReactNode`. This helps when you want to specify that your component accepts children without manually adding a `children`
  prop in your prop definitions.

- **Usage & Benefits:**  
  Instead of manually typing children as `children?: React.ReactNode`, `PropsWithChildren` automatically merges your props
  `P` with the children prop, reducing boilerplate and improving type safety. It's commonly used in function components to
  clearly indicate they accept children, either mandatory or optional.

- **Example:**

  ```tsx
  import { PropsWithChildren } from 'react';

  type MyProps = { title: string };

  const MyComponent: React.FC> = ({ title, children }) => (

      {title}
      {children}

  );
  ```

  Here, `children` is correctly typed without explicitly declaring it in `MyProps`[1][2][3][6][8].

- **Additional Notes:**
  - You can also use `PropsWithChildren` without any other props (`PropsWithChildren` or simply `PropsWithChildren`) when
    your component only accepts children[4].
  - It is preferred over manually declaring `children` in your props for cleaner, safer code[1][2][6].

### 2. React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef

- **Purpose:**  
  This is a utility type that extracts the prop types of a React component or intrinsic HTML element _excluding_ the `ref`
  prop. It is useful when you want to reuse the prop types of built-in or custom components but do not want to deal
  explicitly with the `ref` forwarding.

- **Typical Use Case:**  
  For example, to get the props of a `button` element without the `ref`, you write:

  ```ts
  type ButtonProps = React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef;
  ```

  This allows your custom components or wrappers to accept all the standard props of a native element or another component
  without the complexities of `ref`.

- **Why exclude `ref`?**  
  Because managing `ref` types can be complicated and might not be necessary for your use case, so this type makes it easier
  to type props cleanly.

- **Example:**  
  Suppose you are building a custom button component and want to inherit all native button props except `ref`:

  ```tsx
  type MyButtonProps = React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef & { customProp: string };

  const MyButton = ({ customProp, ...rest }: MyButtonProps) => ({ customProp });
  ```

### Summary table:

| Type                               | Purpose                                                         | Typical Usage                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **React.PropsWithChildren**        | Add `children` prop to existing props type                      | Typing components that accept children, e.g. `PropsWithChildren`         |
| **React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef** | Extract props of component or HTML element _without_ `ref` prop | Extending native element props without handling `ref`, e.g. for wrappers |

In essence:

- Use **`PropsWithChildren`** when you want to **add children** typing automatically to your component props.
- Use **`ComponentPropsWithoutRef`** when you want to **reuse prop types from another component or native element** but want
  to omit the `ref` from those props for simpler typing.

These utilities simplify and enforce safer typings in React + TypeScript apps[1][2][4][6].
