The `@content` directive in your SCSS `@mixin` is a special placeholder that allows you to inject a block of styles or CSS
rules when you include the mixin.

## Explanation of `@content` in SCSS Mixins

When you define a mixin with `@content`, you tell SCSS that this mixin can accept a block of CSS code from where it is
included, and that block will be inserted exactly where `@content` appears inside the mixin.

### Your example:

```scss
@mixin tablet {
  @media (min-width: map-get($breakpoints, "md")) {
    @content;
  }
}
```

- This mixin wraps any styles passed to it inside a media query for the "md" breakpoint.
- The `@content` directive is where the passed styles get injected.

### How to use it:

```scss
@include tablet {
  .example {
    font-size: 18px;
    color: blue;
  }
}
```

This will compile to:

```css
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  /* assuming $breakpoints: ("md": 768px) */
  .example {
    font-size: 18px;
    color: blue;
  }
}
```

## Summary

- `@content` acts as a placeholder inside a mixin.
- When you include the mixin with a block, that block replaces `@content`.
- It is especially useful for wrapping styles inside media queries or other conditional blocks.

If you want, I can provide more examples or explain how to use mixins with `@content` in different scenarios!
