In React, the code snippet

```jsx
Card.Header = Header;
Card.Body = Body;
Card.Footer = Footer;
```

means that you are **assigning subcomponents (`Header`, `Body`, `Footer`) as properties of the main `Card` component**. This
is a common practice in the **compound component pattern**.

### What this achieves:

- It groups related components together under a single namespace (`Card`), making their relationship explicit and improving
  code organization.
- It allows you to use these subcomponents in JSX with a clear, semantic structure, like:

```jsx

  Title
  Content
  Footer info

```

- Each subcomponent (`Header`, `Body`, `Footer`) can be a reusable, independent component, but by attaching them to `Card`,
  it shows they "belong" to the `Card` component family[2][6].

### Why use this pattern?

- It promotes **component composition** and **modularity** by breaking a complex UI component into smaller, manageable parts.
- It improves **code readability** and **API clarity** since the subcomponents are accessed as properties of the main
  component.
- It is widely used in UI libraries like React Bootstrap and Semantic UI to organize components logically[1][3].

### Example from the pattern:

```jsx
function Card({ children }) {
  return { children };
}

function Header({ children }) {
  return { children };
}

function Body({ children }) {
  return { children };
}

function Footer({ children }) {
  return { children };
}

Card.Header = Header;
Card.Body = Body;
Card.Footer = Footer;
```

Now you can use:

```jsx

  My Header
  My Body
  My Footer

```

This pattern is especially useful for building flexible and reusable UI components in React[2][4][6].

**In summary:**  
Assigning `Card.Header = Header` and similar lines means you are creating **compound components** by attaching subcomponents
as properties of the main component, enabling a clean, organized, and semantic way to compose complex UI elements in React.
