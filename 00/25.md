The main difference between **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)** and **Compound Components** in React lies in their purpose,
structure, and how they manage component composition and logic reuse:

| Aspect                     | Higher-Order Components (HOCs)                                                                                          | Compound Components                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**             | A function that takes a component and returns a new enhanced component by wrapping the original one.                    | A pattern where multiple components work together internally, sharing implicit state via React context or props. |
| **Purpose**                | To **reuse component logic** by enhancing or decorating components with additional behavior or data.                    | To create **flexible, composable UI components** that share state and work as a cohesive unit.                   |
| **How it works**           | Wraps a component, often invisibly to the user, externalizing control and injecting props or behavior.                  | Components are nested explicitly in JSX, sharing state and callbacks typically via context or props.             |
| **Control over rendering** | The HOC controls the rendering and props of the wrapped component, abstracting away details from the wrapped component. | The parent compound component controls shared state and passes it implicitly to child components.                |
| **Visibility in JSX**      | The wrapped component is usually hidden inside the HOC, so the consumer sees only the enhanced component.               | All compound components are visible and explicitly used in JSX, making structure and relationships clearer.      |
| **Use cases**              | Cross-cutting concerns like authentication, theming, logging, data fetching, or conditional rendering.                  | Complex UI components like tabs, accordions, dropdowns, where multiple parts interact closely.                   |
| **Example**                | `const Enhanced = withAuth(Component);` — wraps `Component` to add authentication logic.                                | `......` — tabs share state internally but expose simple API.                                                    |
| **Control by children**    | Children are unaware of the HOC’s logic; they receive props from the HOC but don’t control it.                          | Children are aware and cooperate with the parent component’s state and callbacks.                                |
| **Debugging and clarity**  | Can be harder to debug due to abstraction and invisible wrapping.                                                       | Easier to debug and reason about since the component hierarchy is explicit in JSX.                               |

### Summary

- **HOCs** are a pattern to **reuse logic by wrapping components**, enhancing them with additional props or behavior, but
  abstracting control away from the wrapped component. They are often used for concerns like authentication, data fetching,
  or styling.

- **Compound components** are a pattern for building **flexible, state-sharing UI components** where multiple related
  components work together explicitly, sharing state internally but exposing a clean and composable API.

Both patterns promote reusability but serve different architectural roles: HOCs focus on logic reuse via wrapping, while
compound components focus on UI composition and shared state management within a component family[1][2][3][5][6].

Here are clear examples of both a **Higher-Order Component (HOC)** and a **Compound Component** pattern in React:

### Example of a Higher-Order Component (HOC)

A HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new enhanced component, often adding shared logic or behavior.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

// HOC that adds counter state and increment logic
const withCounter = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return class extends Component {
    state = { count: 0 };

    incrementCount = () => {
      this.setState(prevState => ({ count: prevState.count + 1 }));
    };

    render() {
      return (

      );
    }
  };
};

// Example component using the HOC
function ClickCounter({ count, incrementCount }) {
  return (

      Clicked {count} times

  );
}

// Wrap ClickCounter with withCounter HOC to add counting behavior
const EnhancedClickCounter = withCounter(ClickCounter);

export default EnhancedClickCounter;
```

**Explanation:**  
`withCounter` adds counting logic to any component passed to it. `ClickCounter` is wrapped by `withCounter`, so it receives
`count` and `incrementCount` as props, enabling reuse of the counter logic across multiple components[7].

### Example of a Compound Component

Compound components are multiple components that work together, sharing state internally, typically via React context or
props.

```jsx
import React, { useState, createContext, useContext } from 'react';

// Create a context to share state among compound components
const TabsContext = createContext();

function Tabs({ children }) {
  const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0);

  return (

      {children}

  );
}

function TabList({ children }) {
  return {children};
}

function Tab({ index, children }) {
  const { activeIndex, setActiveIndex } = useContext(TabsContext);
  const isActive = index === activeIndex;

  return (
     setActiveIndex(index)}
    >
      {children}

  );
}

function TabPanel({ index, children }) {
  const { activeIndex } = useContext(TabsContext);
  return activeIndex === index ? {children} : null;
}

// Usage
export default function App() {
  return (


        Tab 1
        Tab 2

      Content for Tab 1
      Content for Tab 2

  );
}
```

**Explanation:**  
`Tabs` is the parent component managing shared state (`activeIndex`). `TabList`, `Tab`, and `TabPanel` are child components
that consume this state via context. This pattern allows users to compose tabs declaratively while sharing state implicitly,
making the API flexible and intuitive.

### Summary

| Pattern                    | Key Idea                                                   | Example Use Case                                     |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Higher-Order Component** | Wraps a component to add reusable logic or behavior        | Sharing stateful logic like counters, data fetching  |
| **Compound Component**     | Multiple components share implicit state and work together | Building complex UI components like tabs, accordions |

Both patterns promote code reuse but differ in approach: HOCs abstract logic by wrapping components, while compound
components expose a declarative API with shared internal state.
