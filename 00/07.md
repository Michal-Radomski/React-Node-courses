Operational error in Express.js refers to runtime errors that occur due to external conditions or expected failures during
the execution of an application, rather than bugs or mistakes in the code itself. These errors need to be handled gracefully
to prevent the application from crashing abruptly. Examples include a user requesting a non-existent resource (404 Not
Found), validation failures (400 Bad Request), database connection issues, or external API timeouts. Handling operational
errors properly ensures application stability and a better user experience by providing meaningful error responses without
halting the entire process[1][4][8].

In contrast, programmer errors are bugs in the code, such as calling undefined functions or passing incorrect arguments,
which usually require fixing in the codebase rather than runtime handling[1][4].

Express.js provides built-in mechanisms to catch and process these operational errors via middleware. When an error occurs,
it can be passed to the next middleware using `next(error)`, which then can be handled by custom error-handling middleware or
the default Express error handler. This allows centralizing error handling logic and responding appropriately to clients
without exposing sensitive details in production environments[2][5][7].

In summary, operational errors in Express.js are expected runtime errors caused by external factors or user input issues that
should be caught and managed to maintain application robustness and avoid crashes[1][4].
