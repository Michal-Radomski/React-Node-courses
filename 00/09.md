In Express.js, calling `next(error)` means you are passing an error to the next middleware function that is specifically
designed to handle errors. When you pass anything (except the string `'route'`) to the `next()` function, Express treats the
current request as having encountered an error and skips all remaining non-error handling middleware and routes, moving
directly to the error-handling middleware[1][4][5][7].

### How `next(error)` works in Express.js:

- **Error propagation:** When you call `next(error)`, Express forwards the error to the next error-handling middleware in the
  stack. Error-handling middleware functions are defined with four arguments: `(err, req, res, next)` instead of the usual
  three `(req, res, next)`[7].
- **Skipping normal middleware:** Passing an error to `next()` causes Express to bypass any remaining normal middleware or
  route handlers and jump to the error handlers.
- **Centralized error handling:** This mechanism allows you to centralize error processing and response logic in dedicated
  middleware, improving maintainability[5][7].
- **Asynchronous error handling:** In asynchronous code, errors can be caught and passed to `next(error)` to ensure Express
  handles them properly without crashing the app[1].

### Example usage:

```js
app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  // Simulate an error
  const err = new Error("Something went wrong");
  next(err); // Pass error to error-handling middleware
});

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send("Oops, something went wrong.");
});
```

In this example, calling `next(err)` skips any other middleware or routes and goes directly to the error handler, which logs
the error and sends a 500 response[7].

### Difference from throwing errors:

- Throwing an error inside synchronous middleware will be caught by Express and passed to error handlers automatically.
- However, in asynchronous code, you should catch errors and explicitly call `next(error)` to propagate them correctly[1][2].

In summary, `next(error)` in Express.js is the standard way to signal an error has occurred and to delegate error processing
to the error-handling middleware, ensuring proper error management and response to the client. This helps keep error handling
clean and centralized in your Express application.
