The difference between **`onClick`** and **`onClickCapture`** in React lies in **when** during the event propagation cycle
the event handler is triggered:

### Event Propagation Phases

- **Capture phase:** The event travels _from the root_ of the DOM tree _down to_ the target element.
- **Target phase:** The event reaches the target element.
- **Bubble phase:** The event bubbles _back up_ from the target element to the root.

### `onClick`

- React's `onClick` handler is triggered during the **bubble phase**.
- This means the event handler runs **after** the event has reached the target element and starts bubbling up through its
  ancestors.
- This is the default behavior for most event handlers in React.

### `onClickCapture`

- React's `onClickCapture` handler is triggered during the **capture phase**.
- This means the event handler runs **before** the event reaches the target element, as the event travels down the DOM tree.
- It allows you to intercept the event early, before child elements handle it.

### Practical difference

- If you have nested elements with both `onClickCapture` and `onClick` handlers, the order of execution is:

  1. Parent `onClickCapture` (capture phase, top-down)
  2. Child `onClickCapture`
  3. Child `onClick` (bubble phase, bottom-up)
  4. Parent `onClick`

- Using `onClickCapture` is useful when you want to **handle or intercept events before they reach the target element**, for
  example, for logging, analytics, or preventing certain behaviors early.

### Example

```jsx
function App() {
  const handleCapture = () => console.log("Capture phase");
  const handleClick = () => console.log("Bubble phase");

  return (


        Click me


  );
}
```

Clicking the button logs:

```
Capture phase  (div)
Capture phase  (button)
Bubble phase   (button)
Bubble phase   (div)
```

### Summary

| Aspect            | `onClick`                | `onClickCapture`                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Event phase       | Bubbling (after target)  | Capturing (before target)                    |
| When triggered    | On event bubbling up     | On event capturing down                      |
| Use case          | Normal click handling    | Intercepting early, logging, analytics       |
| React event model | Default for click events | Add `Capture` suffix to handle capture phase |

**In short:**  
`onClick` handles clicks during the **bubble phase** (after the event reaches the target), while `onClickCapture` handles
clicks during the **capture phase** (before the event reaches the target) in React's synthetic event system[1][2][3][7].
