### Meaning of `| (string & {})` in TypeScript

In TypeScript, the syntax `| (string & {})` appears in type definitions, often within type unions (for example,
`'foo' | 'bar' | (string & {})`). If you’re wondering what this means, here’s a breakdown:

#### What Does `string & {}` Mean?

- **Type Intersection**:  
  `string & {}` is an intersection type, meaning _a type that is both `string` and `{}` at the same time_.
- **The `{}` Type**:  
  The `{}` type in TypeScript is a very broad type that matches any non-nullish value (almost anything that's not `null` or
  `undefined`)[6]. It carries no specific structure.
- **String Intersected with `{}`**:  
  When you intersect `string` and `{}`, the result is still just `string`—because every string also matches `{}`. However, to
  TypeScript, `string & {}` is treated as a distinct type, not the exact same as the primitive `string` type[4][6][10].

#### Why Use `string & {}` in Union Types?

Here is a common example:

```ts
type AriaRole = "alert" | "tree" | "treegrid" | (string & {});
```

**Purpose:**

- **Preserve Literal Types**:  
  If you define `type T = "foo" | string`, TypeScript broadens this to just `string` (the union collapses to the supertype).
  By using `string & {}`, you "trick" TypeScript into keeping the string literals ("foo") as a separate possibility alongside
  all other possible strings[6][4].
- **Enable Intellisense for Literals**:  
  Using `string & {}` lets editors suggest the specific literals but still allows any string at runtime. For example,
  auto-completion will offer `"alert"` but still accept any other string[4].

#### How TypeScript Interprets the Type

- `"foo" | "bar" | (string & {})` means either:
  - The literal `"foo"`,
  - The literal `"bar"`,
  - Or _any other string not specifically listed_.
- The `(string & {})` ensures the union doesn't collapse and that literal suggestions are preserved in tooling[6][4].
- From a usability perspective, `(string & {})` is effectively just any string, but in type definitions it serves to enhance
  code experience for developers[10].

### Summary Table

| Construct     | Explanation                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `string`      | Any string value                                                         |
| `{}`          | Any non-null, non-undefined value                                        |
| `string & {}` | Treated as "any string" for practical purposes, but not a string literal |
| `'foo'        | (string & {})`                                                           | Either the literal `'foo'` or any other string |

### Key Points

- **`string & {}`** is virtually the same as `string` but used for type trickery in unions.
- It prevents TypeScript unions from collapsing into a plain `string`, preserving specific literal members within the
  type[6][4].
- This pattern is common in library type definitions and improves editing and type safety experience for
  developers[2][4][10].
