### What Does `as const` Mean in TypeScript?

The `as const` assertion tells TypeScript to treat the value as the most specific and **deeply immutable** version of itself,
rather than generalizing the type. This is especially powerful with arrays and objects.

#### How It Works

With your code:

```ts
const BUTTON_TYPES = {
  0: "warning",
  1: "success",
  2: "error",
} as const;
```

- **Without `as const`:**  
  TypeScript infers the type of the property values as the general `string` type, and the keys as `number`.

- **With `as const`:**  
  TypeScript infers:
  - Each property value as the exact string literal, e.g., `"warning"` not just `string`.
  - Each key as the exact number literal (`0`, `1`, `2`).
  - The object and its properties as `readonly`, making them immutable at compile-time.

#### What Does This Mean in Practice?

- **Type Narrowing:**  
  The values like `"warning"`, `"success"`, and `"error"` are not just strings; they are their exact literal types. This
  helps with type safety and auto-completion.

- **Immutability:**  
  The object and its properties cannot be changed (mutated) in TypeScript code, enhancing safety[3][4][5].

- **Use Case Example:**  
  If you try to do `BUTTON_TYPES = "info";` or `BUTTON_TYPES[3] = "neutral";`, TypeScript will give a compile-time error.

#### Table: Effect of as const

| Without `as const`  | With `as const`                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Keys: `number`      | Keys: `0`, `1`, `2` (specific values)                  |
| Values: `string`    | Values: `"warning"`, `"success"`, `"error"` (literals) |
| Properties: mutable | Properties: `readonly` (immutable at compile-time)     |

#### Summary

- `as const` makes your object:
  - Immutable (at the type level)
  - More strictly and exactly typed with literal types
- This is especially useful when used in combination with union types or for representing enums and constant
  mappings[3][4][5].
