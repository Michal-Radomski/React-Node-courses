You should generally store refresh tokens on the server side in a persistent storage like a database, especially if you want
to be able to revoke them and maintain control over sessions. Refresh tokens are long-lived and need to be revocable, so
storing them in a database or other persistent key-value store is recommended[3]. This allows you to invalidate tokens if
needed, such as when a user logs out or their account is compromised[1].

However, storing them securely is crucial because a stolen refresh token can be used to generate new access tokens and gain
unauthorized access. Best practices include:

- Hashing the refresh tokens before storing them in the database (similar to password hashing) to protect against database
  leaks and timing attacks[3][4][5].
- Avoid storing refresh tokens in client-side storage like localStorage due to XSS vulnerabilities; instead, use secure,
  HTTP-only cookies for web apps or secure OS storage for mobile apps[5].
- If you encrypt refresh tokens in the database, ensure secure key management, but hashing is generally preferred over
  encryption because it is irreversible and safer[3][4].

In summary, saving refresh tokens in a database is advisable for security and session management, but they must be stored
securely—preferably hashed—and never exposed insecurely on the client side[3][4][5]. If you do not need to revoke tokens, you
might avoid storing them server-side, but this limits your ability to control sessions[1].

This approach balances security, control, and usability in token-based authentication systems.
