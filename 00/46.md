**keyExtractor** and **renderItem** are two important props in React Native's FlatList component, each serving a distinct
purpose:

- **renderItem** is a function that defines _how each list item should be rendered visually_. It receives an object
  containing the current item (usually deconstructed as { item }) and returns a React element representing the UI of that
  item. For example, it might return a component displaying the item’s text or image. It is responsible for rendering the
  actual content of each row in the list[1][5].

- **keyExtractor** is a function that provides a _unique key string_ for each list item. React uses these keys to optimize
  rendering performance by tracking which items have changed, been added, or removed. By default, FlatList looks for an
  `item.key` or `item.id`; if these don't exist or you use a custom key name, you must specify keyExtractor to tell FlatList
  how to get a unique key for each item. The function takes the item and its index, and returns a string key[1][2][3][5].

To summarize in a table:

| Prop             | Purpose                                                                | Example Usage                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **renderItem**   | Defines the UI for each data item, receives `{ item }` and returns JSX | `renderItem={({ item }) => {item.name}}`    |
| **keyExtractor** | Extracts a unique key string for each item for React’s list tracking   | `keyExtractor={item => item.id.toString()}` |

They differ in usage because _renderItem_ needs to access the item’s content to render it, usually by deconstructing the
`{ item }` parameter. In contrast, _keyExtractor_ just returns the key and does not need to deconstruct since it simply
references the item directly to return its unique identifier[1].

In practical terms, if your data items have an `id` or `key` property, you may omit the `keyExtractor` since FlatList will
use those by default, but `renderItem` always needs to be specified to define the rendering[5].

This separation of concerns helps React efficiently render and update lists while keeping your UI rendering logic clearly
defined.
