The two methods, **`componentDidCatch`** and **`getDerivedStateFromError`**, are special lifecycle methods in React used to
implement **error boundaries**, which help catch and handle errors in the component tree.

### 1. `componentDidCatch(error, info)`

- It is a **lifecycle method** called **after an error has been thrown by a child component** during rendering, lifecycle
  methods, or constructors.
- It receives two arguments:
  - `error`: The actual error object thrown.
  - `info`: An object containing information about which component stack caused the error (component stack trace).
- Purpose:
  - To **log errors** (e.g., send error reports to monitoring services).
  - To perform **side effects** like analytics or cleanup after an error occurs.
- It is called in the **commit phase**, after React has updated the DOM.
- It does **not update state directly**, but you can call `setState` here to update the error state if needed.

Example usage:

```jsx
componentDidCatch(error, info) {
  // Log error to an error reporting service
  logErrorToService(error, info);
  // Optionally update state here
  this.setState({ hasError: true });
}
```

### 2. `static getDerivedStateFromError(error)`

- It is a **static lifecycle method** called **during the render phase** when an error is thrown in a child component.
- It receives the `error` as an argument.
- Purpose:
  - To **update the component state** to indicate an error occurred, so the component can render a fallback UI.
- Because it is static, it **cannot perform side effects** like logging.
- It returns an object to update the state, typically setting a flag like `{ hasError: true }`.

Example usage:

```jsx
static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
  // Update state to show fallback UI on next render
  return { hasError: true };
}
```

### How they work together in error boundaries:

- `getDerivedStateFromError` lets you update the state to render a fallback UI immediately after an error is detected.
- `componentDidCatch` lets you perform side effects such as logging the error.
- Defining either or both makes a class component an **error boundary**.

### Summary table:

| Method                                   | When called                           | Purpose                            | Can perform side effects? | Updates state?          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `static getDerivedStateFromError(error)` | During render phase when error thrown | Update state to render fallback UI | No                        | Yes (returns new state) |
| `componentDidCatch(error, info)`         | After render phase (commit phase)     | Log error, perform side effects    | Yes                       | Can call `setState`     |

### References

- `componentDidCatch` catches errors in child components and logs them, preventing app crashes[1][2][4][8].
- `getDerivedStateFromError` updates state to show fallback UI after an error[4][6].
- Both methods together define an error boundary component in React[4][6].

**In short:**  
`getDerivedStateFromError` is for updating state to display fallback UI during render, while `componentDidCatch` is for
logging errors and side effects after the error occurs. Both are essential for robust error handling in React class
components.
