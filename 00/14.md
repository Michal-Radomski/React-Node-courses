An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a network security technology that monitors network traffic or system activities to
detect malicious activity, security policy violations, or potential intrusions. It analyzes traffic for known attack
signatures or anomalous behavior and alerts administrators when suspicious activity is detected. IDS can be network-based
(monitoring network traffic) or host-based (monitoring activities on individual devices)[1][2][4][5][6].

### Difference Between IDS and Firewall

| Aspect            | IDS (Intrusion Detection System)                                             | Firewall                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary Function  | Monitors and detects suspicious or malicious activity; alerts administrators | Controls and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules to block unauthorized access |
| Operation Mode    | Passive (listen-only, out-of-band monitoring)                                | Active (inline, directly controls traffic flow)                                                                 |
| Action on Threat  | Generates alerts but does not block or prevent attacks automatically         | Blocks or allows traffic according to configured policies                                                       |
| Placement         | Usually placed out-of-band on the network, e.g., via TAP or SPAN ports       | Placed inline between networks or network segments to enforce traffic policies                                  |
| Goal              | Identify potential intrusions and notify security teams                      | Prevent unauthorized access and attacks by filtering traffic                                                    |
| Detection Methods | Signature-based, anomaly-based, or reputation-based detection                | Rule-based filtering based on IP addresses, ports, protocols, etc.                                              |

In summary, an IDS is designed to detect and alert on potential threats by monitoring network or host activity but does not
block traffic, whereas a firewall actively enforces security policies by allowing or denying traffic to prevent unauthorized
access[1][4][5][6].
