The `__snapshots__` directory is an **automatically created folder by Jest** (and similar testing tools) that stores
**snapshot files** generated during snapshot testing of your components or code.

### What is inside `__snapshots__`?

- It contains `.snap` files, each corresponding to a test file that uses snapshot testing.
- These `.snap` files hold the **serialized output** (usually a rendered UI component's structure) captured during the test
  run.
- The snapshots serve as a **reference** to compare against future test runs to detect unintended changes in UI or output.

### How it works:

- When you run a test with `expect(...).toMatchSnapshot()`, Jest creates or updates a snapshot file inside `__snapshots__`.
- The folder is usually created **in the same directory as the test file**.
- For example, if your test is at `src/components/Button.test.tsx`, the snapshot will be at
  `src/components/__snapshots__/Button.test.tsx.snap`.
- Snapshots are meant to be **reviewed by humans** during code reviews to verify UI or output changes are expected.

### Why is it useful?

- Helps catch unexpected changes in UI or output.
- Makes UI regression testing easier by comparing current render to saved snapshot.
- Snapshots can be updated automatically when changes are intentional.

### Summary

| Aspect              | Description                                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Directory name**  | `__snapshots__`                                             |
| **Location**        | Next to your test files, e.g., alongside `*.test.tsx` files |
| **Contents**        | `.snap` files with serialized snapshots of component output |
| **Purpose**         | Store reference snapshots for UI/output regression testing  |
| **Created by**      | Jest or similar snapshot testing tools                      |
| **Human-readable?** | Yes, meant for review during code changes                   |

### References

- Jest creates `__snapshots__` folders automatically next to your tests to store `.snap` files with snapshot data[1][3][4].
- Snapshots are used to verify that UI or output has not changed unexpectedly[3][4].
- Some developers prefer to configure Jest to move snapshots elsewhere to avoid clutter, but by default they are colocated
  with tests[2][5].

In short, the `__snapshots__` directory is an essential part of snapshot testing in Jest, storing the reference snapshots
your tests compare against.
