The **Render Props pattern** in React is a technique for sharing code and logic between components by passing a **function as
a prop** to a component. This function, called the _render prop_, returns JSX elements and determines what the component
renders.

### Key points about Render Props:

- A **render prop** is a prop whose value is a function that a component calls to know what to render.
- The component that receives the render prop usually manages some state or logic and passes data to the render function.
- This pattern enables **dynamic rendering** and **code reuse** by allowing the parent component to control rendering based
  on data or state from the child component.
- It provides an alternative to higher-order components (HOCs) for sharing behavior, often with clearer prop passing and
  better composability.

### Example:

```jsx
function DataProvider({ render }) {
  const data = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
  return render(data); // Calls the render prop with data
}

// Usage:
 } />
```

Here, `DataProvider` passes `data` to the `render` function, which returns the JSX to render.

### Benefits of Render Props:

- **Reusability:** Components can be reused with different render logic.
- **Separation of concerns:** Logic and rendering are decoupled; stateful components provide data, stateless components
  handle UI.
- **Explicit data flow:** Props passed to the render function make data dependencies clear.
- **Flexible composition:** Easily compose components without deep inheritance or complex HOCs.

### Drawbacks:

- With React hooks, many use cases for render props can be handled more simply, but render props remain useful in some
  scenarios.

### Summary from sources:

> _"A render prop is a prop on a component, which value is a function that returns a JSX element. The component itself does
> not render anything besides the render prop. The render prop can receive data from the component and render something
> dynamically."_ [1]

> _"The term 'render prop' refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a
> function. A component with a render prop uses that function to determine what to render, making behavior portable and
> composable."_ [2]

> _"Render Props pattern enhances component composition by passing a function as a prop, allowing dynamic rendering and
> flexible reuse of components."_ [5]

In essence, **Render Props pattern** is a powerful React design pattern that promotes flexible, reusable, and composable
components by passing rendering logic as a function prop.
