The `map-get` function in Sass is used to **retrieve the value associated with a specific key from a map** (an associative
array of key-value pairs). It takes two arguments: the map and the key you want to look up.

### What it means in your example:

```scss
@media (min-width: map-get($breakpoints, "md")) {
  ...
}
```

Here, `map-get($breakpoints, "md")` looks inside the `$breakpoints` map for the value associated with the key `"md"` (usually
a pixel value like `768px`) and returns it. This value is then used as the minimum width in the media query.

### More details:

- **Maps** in Sass are collections of key-value pairs, similar to objects or dictionaries in other languages.
- `map-get($map, $key)` returns the value for the given key.
- If the key doesn't exist, it returns `null`.
- This function is useful for organizing related values (like breakpoints, colors, fonts) in one place and accessing them
  cleanly.

### Example:

```scss
$breakpoints: (
  "sm": 576px,
  "md": 768px,
  "lg": 992px,
);

@media (min-width: map-get($breakpoints, "md")) {
  // styles for tablets and up
}
```

This compiles to:

```css
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  /* styles */
}
```

### Summary

- **`map-get` fetches a value by key from a Sass map.**
- It helps keep your variables organized and your code more maintainable.
- In your mixin, it dynamically inserts the breakpoint value for the media query.

This makes your styles flexible and easy to update by just changing the map values in one place[1][4][5].
