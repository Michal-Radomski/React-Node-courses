The key difference between **Immer** and **Redux** lies in their roles and functionalities in state management:

- **Redux** is a **state management library** for JavaScript applications that provides a centralized, predictable state
  container. It requires you to write reducers that update state immutably, often involving manual copying of objects and
  arrays to avoid direct mutations. Redux enforces immutability and unidirectional data flow, which helps with debugging and
  predictability of state changes[1].

- **Immer** is a **helper library** that simplifies writing immutable update logic. It allows you to write code that _appears
  to mutate_ the state directly, but under the hood, Immer produces a new immutable state without mutating the original. This
  reduces boilerplate and complexity when updating deeply nested state structures[1][5].

In practice, **Immer is integrated into Redux Toolkit (RTK)**, which is an abstraction over Redux designed to simplify Redux
usage. RTK uses Immer internally so you can write reducers with "mutating" syntax while still maintaining immutability. This
makes reducers easier to write and read without manually spreading or copying state[1][4][5].

### Summary Table

| Aspect               | Redux                               | Immer                                                          |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What it is           | State management library            | Immutable state update helper                                  |
| Purpose              | Manage app state predictably        | Simplify immutable state updates                               |
| How state is updated | Requires manual immutable updates   | Allows "mutable" syntax, produces immutable results            |
| Usage                | Write reducers with immutable logic | Used inside reducers to simplify code (e.g., in Redux Toolkit) |
| Integration          | Core state management               | Used by Redux Toolkit internally                               |

### Additional Notes

- Using Immer adds a small bundle size and runtime overhead, but these are generally negligible compared to the benefits of
  simpler and less error-prone code[2].
- Immer can make debugging slightly harder due to Proxy objects but offers utilities to inspect state properly[2].
- Redux Toolkit is now the recommended way to use Redux, largely because it integrates Immer and reduces boilerplate[4][6].

In essence, **Redux manages the state and enforces immutability, while Immer is a tool that helps you write immutable update
logic more easily, often used within Redux Toolkit to improve developer experience**[1][5].
