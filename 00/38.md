**In React, `lazy` and `Suspense` work together to enable lazy loading of components, improving app performance by loading
components only when they are needed.**

### React.lazy

- `React.lazy()` is a function that lets you define a component that is loaded **dynamically and asynchronously** via
  code-splitting.
- It delays the loading of a component until it is actually rendered, reducing the initial bundle size and speeding up the
  initial page load.
- It takes a function that returns a dynamic `import()` promise and returns a React component that loads on demand.

### Suspense

- `Suspense` is a component that **wraps lazy-loaded components** and handles the loading state.
- It requires a `fallback` prop, which is a React element (like a spinner or loading message) shown while the lazy component
  is being loaded.
- It acts as a placeholder UI until the lazy component finishes loading.

### How they work together

- When React encounters a lazy component inside a `Suspense` boundary, it pauses rendering that component and shows the
  fallback UI.
- Once the lazy component finishes loading, React replaces the fallback with the actual component.

### Benefits

- **Improved initial load time:** Only essential components are loaded upfront.
- **Reduced bundle size:** Defers loading of non-critical components.
- **Better user experience:** Shows a loading indicator while components load.
- **Scalable:** Helps keep large applications performant by splitting code.

### Example usage:

```jsx
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    Loading...}>


  );
}
```

### Summary:

- **`React.lazy()`**: Defines components to be loaded asynchronously on demand.
- **`Suspense`**: Provides a loading fallback UI while lazy components load.
- Together, they enable **lazy loading in React**, optimizing performance by reducing initial load times and bandwidth
  usage[1][5][7].
