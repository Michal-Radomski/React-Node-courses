To protect your Express.js API against common security threats, implement the following best practices:

## Key Security Measures for Express.js APIs

**1. Use Helmet Middleware**  
Helmet sets various HTTP headers to protect against well-known web vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS),
clickjacking, and MIME sniffing. It’s simple to add:

```js
const helmet = require("helmet");
app.use(helmet());
```

Helmet also supports advanced features like Content Security Policy (CSP) and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to
further harden your app[1][3][6].

**2. Validate and Sanitize User Input**  
Never trust user input. Use validation libraries like `express-validator` to check input types and formats, and sanitize
inputs to prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQL injection). Example:

```js
const { body, validationResult } = require("express-validator");
app.post("/user", body("username").isAlphanumeric(), body("email").isEmail(), (req, res) => {
  const errors = validationResult(req);
  if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
    return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
  }
  // Proceed with request handling
});
```

Also, escape user-generated content when rendering views to prevent script execution[1][3][5][6].

**3. Implement Authentication and Authorization**  
Use secure methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, and enforce
role-based access control to restrict resource access[3][5][6].

**4. Use HTTPS**  
Encrypt data in transit by serving your API over HTTPS using SSL/TLS certificates. This protects sensitive data from
interception and man-in-the-middle attacks. Example:

```js
const https = require("https");
const fs = require("fs");
const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync("key.pem"),
  cert: fs.readFileSync("cert.pem"),
};
https.createServer(options, app).listen(443);
```

Also consider enabling HSTS with Helmet to enforce HTTPS[1][5][6].

**5. Implement Rate Limiting**  
Prevent brute-force and denial-of-service attacks by limiting the number of requests per IP within a time window using
middleware like `express-rate-limit`:

```js
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});
app.use(limiter);
```

This helps mitigate automated attacks[1][5][6][7].

**6. Protect Against CSRF Attacks**  
Use CSRF tokens in forms to ensure requests are legitimate and not forged by attackers[3][5].

**7. Keep Dependencies Updated**  
Regularly update all dependencies using tools like `npm audit` to patch known vulnerabilities in third-party
packages[1][5][6].

**8. Use a Reverse Proxy and Harden Network Exposure**  
Avoid exposing your Express app directly to the internet. Use a hardened reverse proxy like Nginx to filter requests, limit
allowed HTTP verbs, and add an additional security layer[7].

**9. Proper Error Handling and Logging**  
Implement custom error handling middleware to avoid leaking sensitive information in error messages and log security-related
events for monitoring and incident response[1][6].

**10. Configure CORS Carefully**  
Restrict Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to trusted domains only, preventing unauthorized third-party websites from
accessing your API[7][8].

By combining these practices—secure headers, input validation, HTTPS, authentication, rate limiting, dependency management,
and network hardening—you can significantly reduce the attack surface and protect your Express.js API from common
threats[1][3][5][6][7].
