The methods `res.writeHead()` and `res.write()` are actually **not native Express.js methods**, but rather come from the
underlying Node.js `http` module's `ServerResponse` object, which Express's `res` object extends.

Here's what each method does in the context of an HTTP response:

---

## `res.writeHead(statusCode, headers)`

- **Purpose:**  
  Sends the HTTP response status code and headers to the client.
- **Parameters:**

  - `statusCode` (e.g., `200`): The HTTP status code indicating the result of the request (200 means OK).
  - `headers` (object): An object containing HTTP headers to send with the response (e.g., `"Content-Type": "text/plain"`).

- **Effect:**  
  It sets the status and headers of the HTTP response before sending any body data.

---

## `res.write(chunk)`

- **Purpose:**  
  Writes a chunk of the response body to the client.

- **Parameters:**

  - `chunk` (string or Buffer): The data to send as part of the response body.

- **Effect:**  
  Sends part of the response body. You can call `res.write()` multiple times to send data in chunks.

---

## How these are used in your example:

```js
res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
res.write(`Hello ${query["name"]}`);
```

- The server sends a **200 OK** status with the header `"Content-Type": "text/plain"`, indicating the response body is plain
  text.
- Then it writes the string `Hello ` (where `` is the value from the query parameter) as the response body.

---

## Important note in Express.js context:

In Express, you typically **don't use `res.writeHead()` or `res.write()` directly**. Instead, Express provides higher-level
methods like:

- `res.status(200)` — to set the status code.
- `res.set()` or `res.type()` — to set headers.
- `res.send()` — to send the entire response body and end the response.

For example, the above can be more idiomatically written in Express as:

```js
res.status(200).type("text/plain").send(`Hello ${query["name"]}`);
```

### Summary

| Method            | Origin         | Purpose                              | Express Alternative                      |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `res.writeHead()` | Node.js `http` | Set status code and response headers | `res.status().set()` or `res.type()`     |
| `res.write()`     | Node.js `http` | Write chunks of response body        | `res.send()` (usually sends all at once) |

---

If you want to stream data or send partial responses, you might still use `res.write()` in Express, but `res.writeHead()` is
rarely used directly because Express manages headers internally.

If you want, I can provide examples of both Node.js native and Express idiomatic ways to handle responses!
