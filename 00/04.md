## What are epoll and IOCP?

### epoll

`epoll` is a Linux kernel system call introduced in Linux kernel version 2.5.45 that provides a scalable I/O event
notification mechanism. It is designed to efficiently monitor multiple file descriptors (such as sockets, files, pipes) to
check if I/O operations are possible on any of them. Unlike older mechanisms like `select()` and `poll()`, which operate in
O(n) time relative to the number of file descriptors, `epoll` operates in O(1) time, making it highly efficient for
applications handling large numbers of file descriptors.

Key features of `epoll` include:

- **Edge-triggered and level-triggered modes:** In edge-triggered mode, `epoll_wait` returns only when new events occur,
  while in level-triggered mode, it returns as long as the condition (e.g., data available to read) holds.
- **Efficient data structures:** Uses red-black trees internally to track monitored file descriptors.
- **Event-driven:** Notifies applications only when events occur, reducing CPU usage compared to continuous polling.

`epoll` is widely used in high-performance Linux servers and networking applications to handle thousands of simultaneous
connections efficiently[1][3][4][5][7].

### IOCP (I/O Completion Ports)

While the search results do not explicitly mention IOCP, based on standard knowledge:

IOCP (I/O Completion Ports) is a Windows operating system mechanism for handling asynchronous I/O operations efficiently. It
allows applications to perform multiple I/O operations concurrently and receive notifications when these operations complete.
IOCP is designed to scale well with a large number of simultaneous I/O requests, making it suitable for high-performance
server applications on Windows.

Key points about IOCP:

- It uses a completion port object to queue completed I/O requests.
- Worker threads retrieve completed I/O events from the port, allowing efficient thread management.
- It supports overlapped (asynchronous) I/O operations on sockets, files, and other handles.
- IOCP is the Windows counterpart to Linux's `epoll` and BSD's `kqueue` in terms of providing scalable asynchronous I/O event
  notification.

In essence, both `epoll` and IOCP are core OS-level facilities designed to efficiently handle large numbers of asynchronous
I/O operations, but they are specific to Linux and Windows platforms respectively.
