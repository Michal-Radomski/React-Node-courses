The `worker_threads` module in Node.js provides the ability to run JavaScript code in parallel threads called Workers. This
allows CPU-intensive tasks to be offloaded from the main thread, enabling better performance for computationally heavy
operations[1][2][3].

### What is `Worker`?

- `Worker` is a class provided by the `worker_threads` module that represents an individual worker thread.
- Each `Worker` runs in its own isolated V8 instance and executes JavaScript code independently of the main thread.
- Workers communicate with the main thread (and each other) via message passing using `postMessage()` and `on('message')`
  events.
- Unlike child processes, Workers can share memory efficiently by transferring or sharing `ArrayBuffer` or
  `SharedArrayBuffer` instances[1][3].

### What is `worker_threads`?

- `worker_threads` is the Node.js module that exposes the `Worker` class and related utilities.
- It enables multithreading in Node.js, which is otherwise single-threaded for JavaScript execution.
- The module also provides helpful properties and methods such as:
  - `isMainThread`: a boolean indicating if the current code is running in the main thread or a worker.
  - `parentPort`: the communication channel for a worker to talk to its parent thread.
  - `workerData`: data passed from the main thread to the worker at creation[1][2].

### Key points:

- Workers are primarily useful for CPU-bound tasks, not for I/O-bound operations since Node.js already handles asynchronous
  I/O efficiently.
- They enable parallel execution of JavaScript code, improving performance for tasks like data processing, parsing, or
  computation.
- Workers can be created from separate files or inline code and can spawn other workers themselves.
- Communication between threads occurs through message passing, and memory can be shared via special buffers.
- Using worker pools is recommended in practice to avoid the overhead of frequently creating and destroying workers[1][2][3].

### Example usage snippet:

```ts
import { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort, workerData } from "worker_threads";

if (isMainThread) {
  const worker = new Worker("./worker.js", { workerData: { num: 42 } });
  worker.on("message", (result) => console.log("Result:", result));
} else {
  // Worker thread
  const result = workerData.num * 2;
  parentPort?.postMessage(result);
}
```

This example shows creating a worker from a separate file, passing data, and receiving a result asynchronously[1][2].

In summary, `worker_threads` is the Node.js module enabling multithreading via `Worker` threads that run JavaScript in
parallel, improving performance for CPU-intensive tasks through isolated threads with message-based communication and
optional shared memory[1][2][3].
