The **`as` prop in React** is a pattern that allows you to dynamically specify which HTML element or React component should
be rendered by a component. Instead of hardcoding a specific tag like `or`, you pass the element type or component as a prop
(commonly called `as`), giving you flexibility and reusability.

### How it works

- The component receives an `as` prop (or sometimes named `component`, `element`, or `variant`).
- Inside the component, this prop is used as a component or tag to render.
- This allows consumers of the component to change the rendered element without changing the component's internal logic or
  styling.

### Example

```jsx
const Headline = ({ as = 'h1', children }) => {
  const As = as;
  return {children};
};

Hello React       // renders Hello React
Hello React // renders Hello React
```

This pattern is especially useful in UI libraries and design systems where you want the same component to render different
semantic HTML elements or custom components while preserving styling and behavior[5].

### Why use `as` prop?

- **Flexibility:** Easily switch rendered elements (e.g., from `to`) without duplicating components.
- **Semantic correctness:** Render appropriate HTML tags for accessibility and SEO.
- **Reusability:** Share styles and logic across different element types.

### Typing `as` prop in TypeScript

When using TypeScript, the `as` prop is often typed as `React.ElementType` to accept any valid React component or HTML
tag[5][8].

In summary, the **`as` prop** lets you customize which element or component a React component renders, enhancing flexibility
and semantic control in your UI components[5].
