The difference between **controlled** and **uncontrolled components** in React lies in how the form data is managed and where
the source of truth resides:

| Aspect               | Controlled Components                                                        | Uncontrolled Components                                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **State Management** | React state manages the form input values.                                   | The DOM manages the form input values internally.                        |
| **Data Flow**        | Data flows _from React state to the DOM_ via props.                          | Data flows _from the DOM to React_ only when accessed via refs.          |
| **Value Binding**    | Input value is bound to React state using the `value` prop.                  | Input value is uncontrolled by React; uses `defaultValue` or no binding. |
| **Event Handling**   | Uses `onChange` handlers to update React state on every input change.        | No continuous event handling; value accessed on demand via refs.         |
| **Form Validation**  | Easy to validate input on every keystroke or change.                         | Validation typically done on form submission or on demand.               |
| **Complexity**       | More code needed (state + handlers).                                         | Less code, simpler for quick or simple forms.                            |
| **Performance**      | More re-renders due to state updates.                                        | Fewer re-renders, potentially better performance.                        |
| **Use Cases**        | Complex forms, real-time validation, synchronization with other UI elements. | Simple forms, quick prototypes, or integrating with non-React code.      |
| **Synchronization**  | Easy to keep input value in sync with React state and UI.                    | Harder to keep in sync without extra work.                               |

### Explanation

- **Controlled components** have their input values controlled by React state. The component renders the input with a `value`
  prop, and updates to the input are handled via `onChange` events that update the state. This makes React the "single source
  of truth" for the input, allowing easy validation, conditional rendering, and synchronization with other UI elements.

- **Uncontrolled components** store their own state internally in the DOM, like traditional HTML form elements. React does
  not manage the input’s value directly but accesses it when needed using refs. This approach requires less code and is
  sometimes easier when integrating React with non-React libraries or for simple forms.

- For example, a controlled text input looks like this:

  ```jsx

  ```

- An uncontrolled text input uses a ref and defaultValue:

  ```jsx

  ```

  You then read the current value via `inputRef.current.value` when needed.

### When to Use Which?

- Use **controlled components** when you need fine-grained control over form data, real-time validation, or synchronization
  with other parts of your React app.

- Use **uncontrolled components** for simpler forms, quick prototypes, or when integrating with non-React code that manages
  its own state.

React’s official recommendation favors controlled components for most use cases because they provide better predictability
and easier state management[1][2][3][4][5].
